## Description

This is my web developer portfolio created using React, Vite and Chakra UI. This is a step up from my previous portfolio created using only HTML and Bootstrap. 

This site is used to showcase my latest projects as a developer to potential employers and how they can contact me. My projects have links to its' repository and deployed website.

This is my first project using React and Chakra UI. At first, I thought they both have a steep learning curve. I read the documentation on Chakra UI and applied the examples in my project. Once I got used to it, I was able to apply responsive styling in the portfolio.

Here's the link to the website: https://cmdnguyen.netlify.app/

The Navigation Bar will take you different pages in the site. It also include the toggle light or dark theme button for the website.

In the About Me page, you will see my bio and some of my technical sklls. If you hover over a skill icon, a tooltip will pop up and tell you what the icon means.

In the Portfolio page, you can see my latest projects and view the repository and deployed website.

In the Contact page, you can see a form for users to put in their name, email and message. For now, the inputs are not stored anywhere. I hope to work more on this soon.

In the Resume page, you can see a button to download my resume and icons to show my technical skills.

The site is responsive in mobile mode. Here's what it looks like in a tablet and smartphone.
