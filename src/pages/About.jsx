        I am currently learning full stack web development in a coding bootcamp.
        Previously, I was a broadcast journalist who has worked in TV markets in Texas and Louisiana.
        I have won a Regional Emmy for best newscasts thanks to my creativty and planning.
        I left journalism to pursue better opportunities and decided to pursue web development.
        My creative, problem-solving and collaborative skills are great assets to any team.
        I like to travel and try different foods.
        I am also an amateur photographer and videographer.
